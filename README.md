Here are key points summarizing your work on the SIDH algorithm using Python programming:

1. **Development of Python Code for SIDH**:  
   - Created a Python-based implementation of the Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) algorithm.
   - Designed the algorithm to define Montgomery elliptic curves over finite fields of Gaussian integers.

2. **Parameter Identification for SIDH**:  
   - Used Python to identify suitable parameters for Montgomery elliptic curves that are supersingular, ensuring compatibility with SIDH requirements.

3. **Implementation of Isogenies**:  
   - Developed Python scripts to compute 2-isogenies and 3-isogenies between elliptic curves.
   - Simulated the isogeny computations crucial for the SIDH protocol.

4. **Practical SIDH Example**:  
   - Created a working example of SIDH over \( \mathbb{F}_{107}(j) \), demonstrating the application of isogenies in a real-world finite field.

5. **Algorithm Verification and Testing**:  
   - Validated the Python implementation by testing the protocol's key exchange process, ensuring correctness and compliance with theoretical expectations.

6. **Optimization for Efficiency**:  
   - Optimized Python code to improve computational efficiency, making it feasible for research and educational purposes.

7. **Post-SIDH Research Transition**:  
   - After the recovery of SIDH, shifted focus to leveraging Python for constructing S-boxes using techniques inspired by post-quantum cryptography.
